# Optional: If you plan to serve your React app from the same /witsReact/ root
# and use client-side routing, you'd add rules here for the React app.
# For example:
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/witsReact/api/.*$ [NC] # Exclude API calls
# RewriteRule . index.html [L]
